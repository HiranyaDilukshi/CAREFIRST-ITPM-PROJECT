Project Name - Online Pharmacy System

Computerized pharmacy management systems are revolutionizing the health care industry. Generally, in a pharmacy, the pharmacist has to work 24 hours due to query management, payment handling, and dues of suppliers and employees. Doing these works manually requires a tremendous amount of time and faces many errors too.
The main objective of the Pharmacy Management system is to manage the details of the Employees, Suppliers, handle pharmacy stock and provide secure payment options. 
The project is totally built at the administrative end and thus only the administrator is guaranteed the access.
